/**
 * Prompt templates for the background memory extraction agent.
 *
 * The extraction agent runs as a perfect fork of the main conversation — same
 * system prompt, same message prefix. The main agent's system prompt always
 * has full save instructions; when the main agent writes memories itself,
 * extractMemories.ts skips that turn (hasMemoryWritesSince). This prompt
 * fires only when the main agent didn't write, so the save-criteria here
 * overlap the system prompt's harmlessly.
 *
 * The forked agent's cacheSafeParams carry: user context (USER.md content
 * including name/role), GAKRCLI_WORKSPACE snapshot (all ~/.gakrcli/workspace
 * /*.md files), the current date, and the current working directory. Use
 * these to make extraction contextual and file-targeted.
